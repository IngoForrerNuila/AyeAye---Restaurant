                <b>Monthly Recommendation</b><br>
                There is nothing more special than sharing a Hen Omby Ritra with your Friends, 
                Family or simply having a night of deliciousness with your loved one.<br><br>

                One of the dishes that became one of the most popular in Madagascar, we now recommend 
                it just this month, where we enjoyed quite tropical and rainy weather. There is nothing 
                more delicious than its delicious and fresh ingredients to have an unforgettable dinner 
                and why not have a Three Horses Beer, while the nocturnal flavor of this dish floods your palate.<br><br>
